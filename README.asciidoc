Whisper is a quick way to leave voice notes for yourself from any phone.  Presently, there are two modes of operation:  
recording a note and listening to your notes.  It should take less than five seconds to start recording a note:  Dial the 
number, press '1', and you're recording a note.  Just hang up when you're done--everything you said is automatically recorded, 
timestamped and associated with your phone number.  To listen to your notes, call the number and press '2.'  Your notes 
are played back, most recent note first.

The system is built on twilio (twilio.com).  When a user calls the  Twilio phone number (+1 617 237 6243), Twilio runs 
the incoming.php script, which handles the voice menu, recording and playback.  Transcription.php is in there to store 
transcriptions of the notes in the database along with the recording URLs, but there's no good way to access that 
feature, so it's ignorable for now.  And connect.php just connects to the database.  Details of the
Database schema are in the file 'database schema.pdf.'  All that matters is the 'messages' table.

To Do:
Add an interface to allow skipping forward and backward through notes and replaying notes.
